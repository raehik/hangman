Hangman
=======

This is an implementation of the Hangman game in Java. An average game usually
goes something like this:

    1. One person thinks of a word/phrase
    2. The rest (2 or more) try to guess the word/phrase character by character

This program simulates those rules, pretty much. One character is guessed at a
time. The number of guesses is set at the same time as the word is chosen.
